Constraining the Values of your data.

1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and 
snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.
create table Dummy_orders  
(  
  onum int(10),
  cnum int(10),
  sname int(10),
  odate date NOT NULL,
  primary key (onum,sname,cnum)
);


2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,
 snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, 
inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
create table Dummy_salespeople
(
  snum int(10) PRIMARY KEY,
  sname varchar(30) check ( substr(upper(sname),1,1) between 'A' and 'B' )  
  city varchar (20),
  comm float(3,2) check default 0.1 NOT NULL, 

);


3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and 
the cnum is greater 
that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.

create table dummy_orders
(
 Onum  int(4) NOT NULL,  
 Amt  float(7,2)
 Odate  date  
 Cnum   int(4) NOT NULL, 
 Snum   int(4)  NOT NULL,
 check (onum > cnum and cnum > snum)
);
